1.18.0 (Pending)
================

Incompatible Behavior Changes
-----------------------------
*Changes that are expected to cause an incompatibility if applicable; deployment changes are likely required*

Minor Behavior Changes
----------------------
*Changes that may cause incompatibilities for some users, but should not for most*

* upstream: host weight changes now cause a full load balancer rebuild as opposed to happening
  atomically inline. This change has been made to support load balancer pre-computation of data
  structures based on host weight, but may have performance implications if host weight changes
  are very frequent. This change can be disabled by setting the `envoy.reloadable_features.upstream_host_weight_change_causes_rebuild`
  feature flag to false. If setting this flag to false is required in a deployment please open an
  issue against the project.
